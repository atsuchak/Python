print(f"If you like {food} "f"then you are {name}. "f"and your email will be {email}")

# some integers. Integers no need any quote

print(f"Hello Mr. {name}. "f"For conferming your {food} "f"I need your email. "f"is {email} is correct? "f"I saw that you are {Age} years old "f"and your weight is {weight} which is overweight. You should avoid pizza.") '''
